                                <h2 align= "Center">The Early Days</h2>
                                    <p>Some of my earliest memories are those playing video games with my dad and my brother. I remember waking up on Saturday mornings, coming downstairs, and seeing my dad playing NCAA Football. <br>The first thing we did on weekends, even before breakfast, was play a game. Growing up with 3 older brothers, I was exposed to great games at a young age. I remember being young and never being able to compete with them. I could never win a game of NCAA against my dad or Motal Kombat against my brothers. Nowadays I always beat them. They quit playing video games as they got older, but I never stopped. Video games have been a big part of my life. They have been a way to connect with friends from far away, relax, and sometimes a distraction from reality. </p>
                                
                                <h2 align ="Center">My First Love: Castlevania</h2>
                                    <p>One of my brother's favorite games growing up was Castlevania. Castlevania came out in the mid 80's. Castlevania was a side-scrolling RPG that focused around a clan of vampire hunters and their never ending quest to rid the world of evil, most notably, Dracula. For as long as I can remember, I have been a huge fan of fantasy gmaes and stories. This is the first game series that I can remember really loving. Unfortunately, when I was first introduced to this game, I was a bit too young to understand the game and play it well. But, this game was my introduction into fantasy games and most importantly RPGs.   </p>

                                <h2 align = "center">Sidetracked</h2>
                                    <p>After my brothers moved out of the house and my dad passed away, I didnt play video games as much. That changed during my sophomore year of highschool. I had an XBOX 360 at the time with one game. I was not very good at video games growing up and nothing had changed ovver the years. My sophomore year of highschool I made a few friends that played XBOX. They introduced me to first person shooters, spcifically, Call of Duty: World at War. Looking back on those days, I can say that those were some wonderful days. My dad had passed away that year and i was finally making friends in school. The summer after sophomore year I am not sure there were many nights where my friends and I werent up until 3a.m. playing Call of Duty. Again, I was not very good at video games. I was actually the worst out of the kids I played with. That didn't matter to me. I loved the competition  and the challenges of the game. When we were on a winning streak we wouldn't stop until we lost. If we were on a losing streak, we wouldn't stop until we won. First person shooters are fun, but they are not my favorite genre of video games.I did't know it but I was about to discover my passion in life.</p>

                                <h2 align = "Center">Finding Myself</h2>
                                    <p>I spent the rest of my high school years palying the various Call of Duty sequels. After high school I had some difficulties in life and in 2012 discovered The Elser Scrolls V: Skyrim. Skyrim is a high fantasy role-playing game that came out in 2011. It was the first open world RPG that I ever played. In the game you create your own character and go on an adventure to save Skyrim from a &quot world eating &quot dragon. You are able to whatever you want, whenever you want. It provided the escape that I needed from my reality at the time. I could turn the game on and suddenly no longer have to worry about what was going on in my life but figure out how to save Skyrim.                               
                                    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/15/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_cover.png" alt = "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim box art" Height = 300 width = 200 >                       
                                    <p> Skyrim was developed by the game studio: Bethesda. I didn't know much about them when I played Skyrim. I found out that I had attempted playing one of the prequels to Skyrim, Morrowind, when I was younger. I never finished it because I was too young to understand the vast concepts of the game. The more I played Skyrim the more that I fell in love with it. Bethesda is a studio known to take years to work on their games so that their fans get the best experience. The main installments of The Elder Scrolls series usually come out every 5-6 years. Skyrim is considered one of the best RPGs, and one of the best games ever made. The 3rd installment, Morrowind, changed the way RPGs were made forever and Skyrim built on that. Years after it's release people began to wonder what was next. The fanbase continually asked when the next game would be announced. The creative director for Bethesda teased that they were thinking about the game for years but never gave any details. Finally this year at E3, one of the biggest entertainment expos in the world, Bethesda officially announced they were working on the next installemnt. In his showcase at E3, Todd Howard announced their first new series in 20 years that they were working on. After a brief preview of the game, Todd Howard said that they were incredibly excited for their new series. Then came the mic drop. Howard then said, "But, we are also building toward the game after that...and it's the one you keep asking about..." The camera that was focused on Howard panned out to show the audience and the applause was euphoric. Everyone in that room, and everyone watching from home knew exactly what he was talking about...the next Elder Scrolls game. Then a video began playing on the screen behind him. The Elder Scrolls games all have a main title and the titles always feature a slow steady drumbeat that builds up. It makes the songs instantly recognizable. This preview to The Elder Scrolls VI was no diffrent. Just thinking about it gives me goosebumps. Skyrim is by far my favorite video game of all time and I cannot wait for the next installment.            
                                
                                <h2 align = "Center">My Hopes and Dreams</h2>
                                    <p>Video games have always been important in my life. They have been such a blessing in my life and I am so grateful to live in a time where they are so readily accessible. I always wanted to work on with video games but never knew how. Now that I am taking this course I have hopes to one day work in the video game industry and maybe, just maybe, work for Bethesda writing code for the future of The Elder Scrolls series. </p>
